# Scrum Framework

**Scrum** is an Agile framework delivering products iteratively through fixed-length **Sprints** (1-4 weeks). There are three main roles which are **Product Owner** (prioritizes requirements), **Scrum Master** (removes blockers), and **Developers**.

**PBIs (**Product Backlog Items) are user-centric work items in the Product Backlog usually relevant to features, bugs,  and tasks, ordered by value. Each Sprint, the team selects PBIs for the **Sprint Backlog**, breaking them into tasks to build a shippable **Increment**. PBIs ensure focus on high-value outcomes, adapt to feedback, and align stakeholders. Refined continuously, they drive transparency, measurable progress, and sprint goals.

# PBIs

# Peer Review

I think most of my group member's PBI can clearly reflect a solid understanding of Scrum principles, with clear user stories and logically organized acceptance criteria. In the peer review phase, I mainly focused on whether their PBIs met the user-centered design concept and whether they have showed explicit details in those PBIs with conditional judgement, validation and error handling. 

During the process, I have found some points for improvement. First of all, it is important to maintain the clarity and precision, in their draft, there existed some ambiguous descriptions. For example, someone directly said to check the "validity" of username and the "complexity" of password, but did not provide a clear standard of acceptable criteria. To ensure the testability and reduce the ambiguity of developers, I suggested to say that "username must be 3–20 characters" and "passwords cannot less than 8 digits". Furthermore, I encouraged peers to clarify metrics. For example, in some draft, some acceptance criterions were about performance and error handling, but just simply used "rapidly navigate to target page" or "unable to upload invalid picture", I thought it would be better to provide a specific time on performance judgement and refine error-handling details, such as adding file type/size limits. Try to avoid inconsistencies, such as alternating terms like “pop-up window” and “message box” which risk confusion. 

Eventually, breaking monolithic PBIs into smaller compositions, such as separate the insertion and deletion from updating operations. To ensure the vertical slices aligns better with Scrum's incremental delivery philosophy.

# Self-review

Through this coursework, I learned the criticality of specificity in PBIs, ensuring acceptance criteria are testable and unambiguous. Peer feedback highlighted my initial vagueness in password complexity, prompting me to define explicit standards (e.g., 8+ characters). Reviewing others’ PBIs revealed the value of vertical slicing—I split “Password Reset” into distinct PBIs for verification and new password setup. This improved alignment with Scrum’s iterative delivery. Incorporating feedback taught me to prioritize clarity over assumptions, use consistent terminology, and integrate performance metrics (e.g., 2-second login). Overall, I grew in crafting user-centric, actionable PBIs that streamline development.
